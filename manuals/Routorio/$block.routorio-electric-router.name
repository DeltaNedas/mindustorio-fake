# Configuration
There are 3 parts to an electric router: mode, operation and number.
Mode is simple, it's either power stored in the router (battery) or power rate. (power node)
Operaration is what it sounds like, which mathematical operator to use.
The number at the end is the comparison number.

The result is a simple expression like "active if storage greater than 4k"
