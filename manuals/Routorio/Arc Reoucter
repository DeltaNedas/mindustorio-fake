# Power generation
Arc routers generate power only when items move, so a clogged arc router is dead.
This means that they may take some time to fully shut down.
[stat]Hint: you can control item flow with copper conveyors and electric routers.[]

# Fuel
[sky]Arc Routers[] will only accept core-storable materials as fuel.
Item conductivity determines [red]lightning arc[] length and count.
Arcs do a lot of damage so make sure to have lots of menders on-site.

# Bars
[sky]Arc routers[] display the current [red]Arcing[] and [coral]Fuel burnup[] chances.

# Affinity guide
[red][[red][] = Arcing chance
[coral][[coral][] = Fuel burnup
[yellow][[yellow][] = Power generation

[stat]xN = Multiplied by N[]
[stat]+/-N% = Modified by N%[]

Multiplication is done first.

# Block affinities
The [sky]Arc Router[]'s stats change when adjacent to these blocks:
	Moderouter: [red]+5%[], [yellow]x1.4 + 25%
	[sky]Arc Router[]: [red]+1%[], [yellow]+50%[], [coral]x1.2

	Plastanium: [red]-2%
	Phase Fabric: [coral]x0.5

	Copper: [coral]x1.2[], [yellow]+40%[]
	Titanium: [red]+8%[], [coral]x1.1[], [yellow]+60%
	Surge Alloy: [red]x1.6[], [yellow]+200%

# Item affinities
These items modify arc amount and damage.

[stat]These should only be used to kickstart fusion routers.
Neutron Router: 100x :)
Sand: 10x
Coal: 8x

[stat]These will do but aren't the best
Lead: 2x
Copper: 2x
Scrap: 3x
Beryllium: 2x
Titanium: 3x
Silicon: 3x
Surge Alloy: 4x

Plastanium: 0.5x (uses RNG to cancel arcs)

Everything else is 1x, and should be used if plastanium is not available.
