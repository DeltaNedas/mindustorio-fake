# Power generation
Arc routers generate power only when items move, so a clogged arc router is dead.
This means that they may take some time to fully shut down.
[stat]Hint: you can control item flow with copper conveyors and electric routers.[]

# Fuel
[sky]Arc Routers[] will only accept core-storable materials as fuel.
Item conductivity determines [red]lightning arc[] length and count.
Arcs do a lot of damage so make sure to have lots of menders on-site.

# Bars
[sky]Arc routers[] display the current [red]Arcing[] and [coral]Fuel burnup[] chances.

# Affinities
The [sky]Arc Router[]'s stats change when adjacent to these blocks:
	Moderouter: [red]Arcing Chance increased[], [yellow]Power [green]multiplied[]
	[sky]Arc Router[]: [red]Arcing Chance[] and [yellow]Power[] [orange]increased[], [coral]Fuel Burnup [red]multiplied[]
	Plastanium: [red]Arcing Chance[] [green]decreased[]
	Phase Fabric: [coral]Fuel burnup[] [green]halved[]
	Surge Alloy: [yellow]Power[] [green]increased[], [red]Arcing Chance multiplied[]
